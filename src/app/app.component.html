<!-- Common Threats -->
<div class="third">
  <p id="cct">Common Cyber Threats</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Phishing</li>
    <p>
      These are fake emails, texts, or websites that try to trick you into giving away personal information like passwords or bank details.
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If something looks suspicious, don't click it!
    </p>

    <li>Malware</li>
    <p>
      Short for “malicious software.” These programs can infect your device, steal your data, or spy on what you're doing.
      Examples: Viruses, spyware, trojans.
    </p>

    <li>Ransomware</li>
    <p>
      This type of malware locks your files or device and demands payment to unlock them. It's like digital kidnapping!
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Never pay — and always back up your files.
    </p>

    <li>Password Attacks</li>
    <p>
      Hackers use tools to guess or steal your passwords to break into your accounts.
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Use long, unique passwords — and don't reuse them.
    </p>

    <li>Fake Websites & Apps</li>
    <p>
      Some websites or apps are designed to look real but are actually fake — made to steal your information.
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Double-check web addresses and only download apps from official stores.

    Staying safe online requires a mix of smart habits and the right tools. Here are some key tips to protect yourself and your information:
  </p>
  <ol class="fl">
    <li>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</li>
    <p>Create long passwords with a mix of characters and don’t reuse them across sites.</p>

    <li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</li>
    <p>Use a second layer of verification like phone codes or apps for added security.</p>

    <li>Be Careful with Emails and Links</li>
    <p>Phishing emails can look real. Don’t click suspicious links or open unknown attachments.</p>

    <li>Keep Your Software Up to Date</li>
    <p>Install updates regularly. They patch security holes hackers can exploit.</p>

    <li>Use Secure Networks</li>
    <p>Public Wi-Fi is risky. Use VPNs if you must connect on public networks.</p>

    <li>Regularly Back Up Your Data</li>
    <p>Use external drives or cloud storage to protect against ransomware or data loss.</p>

    <li>Limit Personal Information Sharing</li>
    <p>Don't overshare on social media. Cybercriminals can use it against you.</p>

    <li>Use Antivirus and Firewall Software</li>
    <p>These block malware and monitor traffic to keep intruders out.</p>

    <li>Log Out from Shared Devices</li>
    <p>Always log out and clear data on public computers.</p>

    <li>Educate Yourself and Others</li>
